# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

A personal website celebrating **Aldrich 109** — the legendary classroom at HBS and home of Section H. The design aesthetic is retro and clean, inspired by Tron (dark backgrounds, glowing grids, neon accents).

## Tech Stack

- **React + Vite** — frontend framework and build tool
- **Tailwind CSS** — styling

## Development Commands

```bash
npm install        # install dependencies
npm run dev        # start local dev server
npm run build      # production build
npm run preview    # preview production build locally
```

## Design & Code Rules

- Keep the site simple and fast — no unnecessary dependencies
- Use semantic HTML for accessibility
- Everything must be responsive and mobile-friendly
- Visual direction: retro Tron aesthetic (dark palette, neon/glowing elements, clean grid layouts)
